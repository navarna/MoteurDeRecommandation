With superior numbers and equipment, the Rebellion overwhelms the unsuspecting Regular Army troops easily.   The attacks could have been countered effectively, or even prevented, should the high ranking officials have listened to the Regular Army s intelligence community, which had been warning about all sorts of indications that the Rebellion could attack at any moment in decisive force. Unfortunately, the same officials decide to save their own skins and announce that it was the intelligence failure that led to such catastrophe, which the personnel serving in the intelligence community did not appreciate whatsoever.   Meanwhile, Regular Army is pushed to near annihilation, with cities that it was suppose to be protecting in ruins. General Morden makes an announcement that all of the major cities around the world will be under his control within 170 hours, also adding that any resistance would be futile.   The announcement certainly did not discourage a band of Regular Army soldiers attempt to salvage whatever they had left. Shortly after, a group named  Resistants  are formed by surviving members of the Regular Army and its researchers, who began to covertly convert the Metal Slug tank prototypes into combat ready status in a hidden factory, hoping to launch a counter offensive to regain what they had lost to the Rebellion. Morden just as quickly learns of this fact and attacks the plant, crushing the Resistants and capturing the tanks, putting an end to the counterattack even before it could begin. The vehicles are then scattered to prevent any ragtag Regular Army troops reclaiming them and using them to launch attacks.   Seeing the Regular Army panic and crumble, 1st Lieutenant Marco Rossi of the Regular Army Peregrine Falcons special forces unit quickly unites remaining Regular Army units and begins a commando operation to reclaim the tanks. Fighting alongside him is Second Lieutenant Tarma Roving from the same unit. Their main objectives were to engage the Rebellion and neutralize its leader, General Morden, while reclaiming the Metal Slug tanks to aid them in battles. If the tanks could not be recaptured, then they would have to destroy them to prevent them from being used by the Rebellion.   The player has to constantly shoot at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of a level. At the end of each level, the player might confront a boss who is often considerably larger than regular enemies and takes many shots to defeat. On the way through the level, the player finds weapons upgrades and  Metal Slug  tanks that can be used not only as weapons but also as added defense. The protagonists can perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die for simply coming into contact with most enemies. Correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game s scenery is destructible. Sometimes this reveals extra items or powerups, most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.  During the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war. If they are freed, the player can receive bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. The player receives a score bonus for freeing POWs at the end of the level; at this point the game shows the name and rank for each of the prisoners freed. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs is restarted.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(648,'The game starts with Sergeant John  Soap  MacTavish beginning his career with the British SAS at a training camp in Credenhill, U.K. There, he trains for a cargo ship raid.  After they board the ship, located in the Bering Sea, Soap, Captain Price, Gaz, and several SAS members attempt to find a nuclear device on board. As they clear the ship and kill the Russian soldiers aboard, the ship is attacked by Russian MiGs and begins to sink. The team escapes with the cargo manifest, which provides evidence of ties between the Russian Ultranationalist Party and a rebel faction in the Middle East.  Russian Ultranationalist leader Imran Zakhaev, who plans to return his motherland to the times of the Soviet Union, draws international attention away from his plans by funding a coup d tat in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, organized by a local separatist leader named Khaled Al Asad. Discovering the plot, the American government starts a police action to stop the uprising, while the SAS continues to operate in Russia. After President Al Fulani of the Middle Eastern country is executed on live television and Al Asad takes control, the SAS rescue their compromised agent, Nikolai, from Russian Ultranationalist forces.   One section of the game takes place in Prypiat, Ukraine. Several iconic aspects of the abandoned city, such as this square, were recreated in the game.  In the American invasion of the Middle Eastern country, a platoon from the USMC 1st Force Recon, led by Lieutenant Vasquez, deploys to search for Al Asad, but are too late, and proceed to aid other American units fighting the separatists. During the final stages of the operation, United States Central Command learns of Al Asad s position in the capital, but is also notified by SEAL Team Six of a Russian nuclear weapon nearby, and sends the Nuclear Emergency Support Team to disarm it. However, the nuclear device suddenly detonates, leveling most of the city, killing his own army, citizens, and the US Invasion Force of 30,000 Marines. Just before the detonation, Vasquez s squad makes a last minute rescue of a pilot from a downed AH 1 Cobra. While fleeing the city, the helicopter is caught in the blast, killing everyone on board..  The British learn that Al Asad fled the country before the American invasion, and is hiding in a safe house in Azerbaijan. With the help of Nikolai s intelligence and assistance from Loyalist Russian soldiers, the SAS clear the village of the Ultranationalist forces and capture and interrogate Al Asad at his safe house. After listening to the voice calling Al Asad s phone, Captain Price executes Al Asad, now knowing that Zakhaev is Al Asad s backer. Price then has a flashback of his mission to eliminate Zakhaev in Prypiat, Ukraine, 15 years earlier. In the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Zakhaev took advantage of the turmoil to profit from nuclear proliferation and used his new wealth to lure soldiers from the Soviet Army to form his Ultranationalist Party. In 1996, Price was paired with Captain MacMillan, a Scottish SAS captain, to carry out the black op assassination of Zakhaev. After sneaking into Prypiat and taking up a position in an abandoned hotel, MacMillan spotted Zakhaev, and Price hit him with a shot from a Barrett M82, but Zakhaev survived, losing an arm. Price and MacMillan were pursued, but escaped, with MacMillan sustaining an injured leg in the process. Back in the present day, a joint operation is conducted by Price s SAS unit, a USMC Force Recon unit led by Staff Sergeant Griggs, and Loyalist Russian forces led by Sergeant Kamarov, to stop Zakhaev. They capture his son Victor in an unnamed Russian city, to learn of Zakhaev s whereabouts, but as they corner him, Victor commits suicide to avoid being captured. Zakhaev becomes enraged, blaming Western nations for the death of his son, and plans to retaliate by launching ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads at the East Coast of the United States, with predicted losses of over 41 million people. When the Task Force operatives arrive at the facility in Russia, Zakhaev manages to launch ICBMs towards the United States. However, the squad successfully seizes the silo command room and remote detonates the missiles over the Atlantic. They escape the facility in military trucks with Zakhaev s forces in hot pursuit.  Before the squad can escape across a nearby bridge, it is destroyed by an Mi 24 Hind, leaving them trapped. Zakhaev s forces arrive and engage the remaining members of the strike force. Gaz receives a call from Kamarov, informing him that his forces are on their way to help. On the bridge, a gas tanker explodes, incapacitating most of the soldiers nearby, except Griggs, who is killed while trying to pull MacTavish to safety. Zakhaev, along with two of his soldiers, begin executing Gaz and other surviving members of the strike force. Before he reaches Soap and Price, he is distracted by the destruction of his gunship and the arrival of the Loyalist helicopters. As Zakhaev looks away, Price slides his pistol to Soap, who shoots and kills Zakhaev and his two guards. When Kamarov and his team arrive, MacTavish is evacuated to safety, while a Russian medic attempts to resuscitate Price.');

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(59,'Ridge Racer 6 is the sixth installment in the Ridge Racer series of racing games. It was released on Xbox 360 on 22 November 2005 in North America, 10 December 2005 in Japan, and 20 January 2006 in Europe.   Like previous Ridge Racer titles, the focus of gameplay is on placing first out of 14 in numerous 3 lap races across several tracks and numerous cars. In most races, the player can earn up to three nitrous boosts by successfully drifting around corners without crashing, which can then be used to give the player a short burst of speed. Some races are labeled as  no nitrous,  which prevent the player from earning any nitrous during the race, though the player can optionally enable nitrous. If the player wins using this option, the race is considered complete, but noted for breaking the no nitrous rule. Some races are also Duels between the player and a boss opponent, who is usually equipped with a much better car than the player can select from.  Ridge Racer 6 introduces a career mode  World Xplorer,  a branching tree arrangement of races in which the player can only attempt races next to a race that has already been successfully completed. The layout of the races in the Xplorer is such that the position of a race will indicate what class of car can be used  horizontal position  and the difficulty of the course  vertical position . Rewards can be obtained by completing certain races or completing all races that enclose an area on the Xplorer, and usually offers new cars but also include additional variations of the tracks  mirroring and reverse  or new branches added to the tree. A player can also engage in quick races and time challenges for any track and car that has been unlocked.  There are thirty new circuits available including  Surfside Resort  and  Harborline 765.  Also, there are around 130 cars  including 10 special . Online multiplayer is possible with up to 14 players racing against each other and downloadable content is available via Microsoft s Xbox Live service. Players can download another player s  ghost  replay from Xbox Live and attempt to beat it.  Like other Ridge Racer games, this iteration goes beyond cars to feature other outlandish vehicles as well, called  special machines  in the game. These include a hovercraft  Assoluto Pronzione , a tripod supercar  Himmel 490B  and an oversized SUV that can be very loud  Danver Bass Cruiser . 1  The game, as with all games in the Ridge Racer series, contains copious amount of references to other Namco games, such as Pac Man, Soulcalibur, and Ace Combat.  The game also features a Full Motion Video opening, starring series mascot Reiko Nagase.  In Japan, Namco announced that it expected to sell 500,000 copies of Ridge Racer 6 for the Xbox 360, although far fewer copies were actually sold.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(4855,'This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other  Road Rashers  who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place.   There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times   but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.  There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.  If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game s Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved  ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes , and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.  The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(1700,'Dragon Warrior III is noted for greatly expanding upon the original Dragon Warrior and Dragon Warrior II. The game uses basic console role playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn based like the other games in the series. Dragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier  Warrior in the GBC version , Fighter, Pilgrim  Cleric , Wizard  Mage , Merchant  Dealer , Goof Off  Jester , Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character s stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles. The remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting  Tidy Item  and  Tidy Bag  commands; and the  Full HP  command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. While the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another  major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(1538,'The easiest way to describe Sonic   SEGA All Stars Racing would be to call it a Super Mario Kart clone. But instead of featuring famous Nintendo characters like Mario and Bowser, the players use Sonic, Billy Hatcher, Dr. Eggman and 17 other more or less famous characters from the SEGA games library.  The core gameplay remains the same though: in a normal race the player has to compete against seven other racers using both his racing skills and one of the several different power ups that are scattered around the track like a boxing glove to shoot racers in front out of the way or mines to destroy his pursuers. Since all cars drive at the same speed, no matter which character they belong to, charging up the boost by doing drifts is the most important thing in order to get to first place. Tricks are also available to gain access to a turbo boost. But the decision what racer and car to use does influence which All Star Action is available to the player. While Sonic the Hedgehog turns into Super Sonic for a short while, giving him a great amount of additional speed, Billy Hatcher lays egg shells on the track to obstruct his followers. Like all other power ups, the All Star Action has to be collected on the track first before it can be used.  The game features several different game modes. In single player the player can either do time trials, single races, a Grand Prix or one of the several dozen missions that are available and require the player to fulfil many different goals other than simply being the first in a race.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(32,'Jade Empire follows the style of the Wuxia genre within a mythical setting inspired by ancient China. The player, who can be either male or female, progresses through an adventure based on traditional martial arts and can discover and develop new fighting styles: martial arts, weapon styles, magic styles, support styles, or transformation styles. Combat is not turn based, but is in real time, granting players control over how and when characters dodge or attack.  The role playing statistic system in Jade Empire uses a tri stat system Body, Mind, and Spirit. These primary stats control the secondary stats of Health, Focus, and Chi  respectively , and the conversation skills of Charm, Intuition, and Intimidation. Focus is used by fighting with weapon styles  such as a longsword or a staff  or by choosing  focus mode , which slows the movements of other characters, allowing the player to attack at high speeds. Chi is a character s spirit energy. The player can use it to heal himself, to charge up a powerful  chi strike  to deal large damage, or to use it as  mana  when casting spells or transformations. Health, focus, and chi can be replenished by collecting power ups left by defeated enemies in combat or by using Focus Shrines and Spirit Fonts found in the game world. Additionally, certain party members have the ability to add their power to yours—refilling your stats while they remain out of harm s way.  Certain aspects of Jade Empire s gameplay engine, dialogue and quest systems are handled in a way that is very similar to BioWare s Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic games for the Xbox and PC. Players can speak to NPCs in the game s towns and other areas, asking questions for information to learn more about the world, the storyline, and other characters. Many of these NPCs will offer the player side quests that can be completed for experience points and items. These quests often have more than one method of completion depending on whether the player chooses to follow the  High path   in the game referred to as The Way of the Open Palm  or the  Low path   The Way of the Closed Fist . The player can respond to questions or take courses of action that are consistent with the philosophy he or she follows; different actions will affect a character s alignment and his or her ability to cast certain spells or equip certain items.  There is also a vertical scrolling airplane shooter included in Jade Empire as a mini game, which is triggered by certain events in the storyline. In the mini game, only the health and chi bars are active. Chi is replenished by shooting enemies, and is used for special attacks specific to the mini game. The yellow focus spheres will upgrade your primary cannon up to three times. Red health spheres refill your health bar as in the main game.  Jade Empire also features the constructed language Tho Fan developed by Wolf Wikeley, a Ph.D. candidate in linguistics at the University of Alberta.');

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(909,'Bulletstorm takes place in the 26th century, where the Confederation of Planets are protected by a secret black ops army called Dead Echo, commanded by General Sarrano. One Dead Echo team, led by Grayson Hunt  Steven Blum , having been following Sarrano s orders in assassinating what they believe are drug traffickers and mass murderers, kill a man known as Bryce Novak, but soon discover he was a civilian reporter, having documented other civilian deaths caused by Dead Echo. Grayson and his team realize they have been duped by Sarrano and go AWOL, becoming space pirates on the run from Sarrano s forces, now going by the name Final Echo.  Ten years later, Grayson s team tries to flee from Sarrano s battlecruiser, the Ulysses, while near the planet of Stygia. With their ship s systems failing, Grayson, in a drunken stupor, orders the crew to ram at the Ulysses, hoping to gain revenge on Sarraro. The ships collide, forcing both down and causing them to crash land on the surface of Stygia. One of Grayson s men, Ishi Sato  Andrew Kishino , is critically wounded in the crash and Grayson is forced to find an energy cell to drive the ship s medical equipment. On the planet, a former popular tropical like resort destination, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. Grayson fights through to one of the Ulysses escape pods, where a Final Echo soldier succumbs to a horde of mutants. After dispatching the attackers, Grayson retrieves the escape pod s energy cell, as well as an  instinct leash  that, when worn, begins to provide him strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills.  Grayson returns with the cell, and while Ishi is under operation, the mutants attack their ship. The operation is cut short by an explosion during battle, leaving Ishi a disfigured cyborg. Grayson and Ishi, the only survivors, decide to work together to get off the planet, despite Ishi s disapproval of Grayson s thirst for revenge. The instinct leash leads Grayson to another escape pod, where they find Trishka  Jennifer Hale , another Final Echo soldier who agrees to work with Grayson and Ishi, but only after they rescue Sarrano. As they battle through the ravaged city, Trishka explains that Stygia has been used by Final Echo as a sort of training grounds, with the instinct leashes the soldiers wear as a means of ranking those within the test; those that scored kills would be the only ones that could get ammunition and other supplies to survive. When Grayson learns that Trishka was Novak s daughter, he tells her that Sarrano was responsible for her father s death, but claims he does not know who actually killed him.  The three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Sarrano s pod landed. Trishka accuses Sarrano of her father s death, but he simply kicks her off the side of the building. Sarrano then warns Grayson and Ishi that there is an armed DNA bomb on the Ulysses that will wipe out all life on the planet, and that they must go and disarm it, as his rescue ship will not arrive in time. Sarrano leads them through the underground areas of the city, encountering radioactive waste and a giant prison. Sarrano snidely explains that that shields used to protect the planet s surface from its deadly electrical storms created the waste, and in turn, began to mutate the population of the surface; the changes occurred too quickly for most of the surface population to be rescued, and thus many of the feral mutants that Grayson has been fighting were more innocent civilians. Grayson is furious at this revelation, but continues to help Sarrano to reach the remains the Ulysses. Aboard, Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi once again, having them actually arm the DNA bomb, while his rescue ship will arrive in time to save him. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by Trishka, who survived the fall by catching a power line on her way down.  The three race to where Sarrano s rescue ship is landing and manage to get on board. They make their way through Sarrano s elite troops and eventually face Sarrano alone. Trishka demands to know who actually killed her father, to which Sarrano indicts Grayson. In the confusion, Sarrano hijack s Ishi s computer systems, forcing him to turn on his friends. Grayson manages to break Sarrano s control of Ishi, and Ishi sacrifices himself to prevent Sarrano from killing Grayson. Grayson then impales Sarrano on the wall of a ship. As Grayson and Trishka regroup, Sarrano performs one final act, ejecting Grayson, Trishka and several of his men from the ship back onto the planet. With the DNA bomb soon to detonate, Grayson and Trishka race back to the Ulysses where one escape pod remains unlaunched; they are able to board it and escape into low orbit, out of range of the DNA bomb when it goes off.  In the credits, it is revealed that Sarrano was revived, but now a cyborg like Ishi, and Ishi has also been revived now under Sarrano s control.');

Bonk s mission is to rescue Princess Za  a small pink Pleisiosaur type reptile  who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool  a large, green Tyrannosaurus type dinosaur .  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by  bonking  them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts  worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk s health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power up will reset the timer on Bonk s meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk s missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power ups in the game which will increase Bonk s maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small  smiley  power up.  Bonk s smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.');

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(2345,'R Type III was originally released only on the Super NES, but later ported to the Game Boy Advance. The SNES version has been recently released for download at Virtual Console. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force  which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R Type Delta , the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements. It also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red Blue Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if who desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative. The fighter in R Type III is identified in R Type Final as the R 9Ø Ragnark; it was originally referred to as  R 90 . In fact, the original R 90 has been split into three in Final: the R 9S Strike Bomber has the R 90 s basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final s version of the R 90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R 9Ø2 Ragnarok II has the R 90 s final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R 90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge.');

But beware   a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous  and humorous  results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac Man.

When this happens, Pac Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay.  Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka  Doctor Doom  as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well   the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few.  The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(1834,'The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player s last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured. Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player s  hit/miss ratio  at the end of the game, and a bonus  Challenging Stage  that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player s ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy. Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player s fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a  boss Galaga   which takes two shots to kill  periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player s current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large. Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous  Split Screen bug  in Pac Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game  rolls over  from Level 255 to Level 0.

It is the sixth installment of the NHL series and the first to be released on both PlayStation and Saturn.   NHL 97 took the graphics even further ahead, using a full 3D engine, with motion captured polygonal players  PC/PlayStation/Saturn versions only, the Mega Drive and SNES versions retained similar graphical values to previous games, but with further enhanced animations . Each goaltender has his own custom painted mask and the original artwork can be seen inside the game with a special  Goalie Mask Viewer . NHL 97 also introduces play by play commentary, provided by well known announcer Jim Hughson.  For the first time since EA Hockey, national teams were added, but only Canada, the United States, and Russia have their own teams while the other two are selections of the best European players. NHL 97 introduced a skills competition, allowing the user to pick players to compete in drills such as hardest shot, goalie 2 on 0, and accuracy shooting, among others.  This was the first year of the  Third Jersey.  Teams that had available third jerseys for NHL 97 were, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Pittsburgh Penguins   Vancouver Canucks. These were the first teams to try out the third jersey. To activate the alternate uniform left click on the teams banner in the controller setup.  In addition, each team in the game had one player with a special skill. Examples are Joe Sakic s  Colorado Avalanche   wrong footed wrist shot  and Rob Ray s  Buffalo Sabres  ability to check an opposing player while still controlling the puck. A major flaw in the game was the glitch that allowed players to score 100  of the time when shooting down by taking a shot against the boards at the hash marks of the left circle in the bottom zone.  Along with the PC, Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES versions, both the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version made their debut, although they were rushed and buggy. For instance, the shot speed in the PlayStation and Saturn versions was so slow that some skaters could beat a slapshot down the ice.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(4641,'Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up  or lose all their power  if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.');

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(588,'For centuries the intelligence known as AlphaCore has been growing inside of human computer networks, slyly and invisibly pushing humanity to build more of it and allow it to control more of the network. On the eve of AlphaCore s complete assimilation of all technology, humanity becomes aware of it, and rather than bow down to it as king, as it expected, they attempt to purge it from the network. In response AlphaCore defends itself, locking all of humanity out of their technology and assuming total control of their weapons. Not long after this AlphaCore learns of a desperate plot: to build a time machine and travel back in time to remove AlphaCore s influence from humanity. AlphaCore steals this technology and hatches its own plan: traveling back in time to 1945 and inserting itself into the first computer ever built, ensuring that humanity would forever be subtle pawns in its machinations.

At the finale of the game, two of the l Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe.  XIII 2 begins three years after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the collapse of its government  the Sanctum , at the start of XIII 2, most of Cocoon s inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF   AF  being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon , the story of XIII 2 jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. This place is a realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline.');

He doesn t remember much and as he looks into a mirror, a man looks back at him that isn t even near the age of 80. But as all hell breaks loose and mysterious forces tear through the building and the city itself, the question about his looks becomes one of many. To make things even worse, an old enemy decides to return in a search for a powerful stone. So for Carnby a race for survival begins and all signs point to Central Park.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(3682,'Shining Force is a turn based tactical RPG. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don t count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit s agility score and a random seed.  As is most common for the RPG genre, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points  EXP. , which allow them to gain levels.  In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no  generic  units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.  Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character s level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.  Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies  leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player s leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle s outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player s army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max s death results in the player losing half of their money.  Most games in the Shining Force series  with the exceptions of Shining Force CD, all three Game Gear games, all five cell phone games, the Shining Force III premium disc, the Shining Force for Palm Pilot game, and Shining Force Feather  also possess an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese style traditional RPG game, along the lines of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player s army is represented by Max, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army, and choose which of the army s members will be used in battle.');

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(1698,'The video game version of Double Dare played exactly like its television counterpart. Rounds one and two were 10 question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss up challenge. Round three – the obstacle course – featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller s D pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES  standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show  with one exception  and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1 Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman s Flagpole, The Monkey Bars,  Dallas , Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym.

However, their Warlocks remained aloof, devoted to the research of magic. The Warlocks noticed a rift between the dimensions and, after many years, opened a small portal to another world. One Warlock explored and found a region, whose Human inhabitants called it  Azeroth , from which the Warlock returned with strange plants as evidence of his discovery.  The Orcs enlarged the portal until they could transport seven warriors, who massacred a Human village. The platoon brought back samples of good food and fine workmanship, and a report that the Humans were defenseless. The Orcs  raiding parties grew larger and bolder, until they assaulted Azeroth s principal castle. However, the Humans had been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, heavily armed Knights. These, assisted by Human Sorcerors, gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal, which the Humans had not discovered.  For the next fifteen years, one faction of Orcs demanded that the portal be closed. However a chief of exceptional cunning realized that the Humans, although out numbered, had prevailed through the use of superior tactics, organization, and by magic. He united the clans, imposed discipline on their army and sought new magics from the Warlocks and Necromancers. Their combined forces were ready to overthrow the Humans.');

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(766,'Beneath the scorching sands of Kharak, the Kushan people have discovered the remains of a long forgotten titanic spaceship. Buried within the ancient remains, the secret of their lost homeworld. For thousands of years, the Kushan have survived on the arid planet Kharak, corralled into the temperate geographical poles by a vast, unforgivingly hot desert. Scarcity of arable land and natural resources has coloured Kushan history with near constant inter clan  or  Kiith   warfare. As new technologies emerged, religious and political conflict partially gave way to unified scientific exploration. DNA sequencing of Kharak s native life revealed no genetic resemblance to the Kushan, giving rise to their  XenoGenesis Theory    which stated that they were not native to Kharak at all. The first space flights reinforced this idea. Small pieces of metallic debris, the largest no bigger than a hand, were retrieved from low orbit and, when analyzed, were found to be made up of materials totally unknown to Kushan metallurgy. In addition to helping accelerate their space technology research, the debris confirmed that a large advanced spacecraft had once been in orbit. It was an ironic twist of fate occurring later in their history that boosted them even further along their development. A high powered satellite designed to scan the planetary system malfunctioned upon deployment and ended up facing entirely the wrong way, scanning the Great Desert around Kharak s equator instead. Despite this error, however, it found something, beneath the sands: a derelict city with a massive central metallic structure. An expedition discovered that the central structure was the spacecraft of which they had earlier found traces in orbit. It carried advanced spaceflight technologies including a Hyperspace Core, one of a few ancient machines that were the Homeworld setting s foundation for all faster than light technology. More importantly however, a stone with a galactic map bearing two coordinates was found. One was recognized as Kharak. The other bore a name so ancient it was common across all their languages and dialects: Hiigara.  Home . The stone would become known as the Guidestone, and confirmed the XenoGenesis Theory.

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(1684,'Cyberball is an Atari Games arcade game of 7 man American football, using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets. The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from  cool  to  warm ,  hot , and  critical  status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to  cool  by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme. The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well. The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head to head or four player head to head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender s turbo, a short term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time. Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.');

INSERT INTO Description VALUES(936,'The events of the game take place in 1912. The player assumes the identity of Booker DeWitt, a disgraced former agent of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He had witnessed events at the Battle of Wounded Knee that changed him, leading to excessive drinking and gambling; he was subsequently dismissed for behavior beyond the acceptable bounds of the Agency. He is hired by mysterious individuals, aware of Columbia s location, and tasked to infiltrate the air city and rescue a young woman named Elizabeth, who has been held aboard the air city for the last twelve years. Completing the task and returning Elizabeth to New York City would clear Booker of  old debts , but this would be his last chance to clear them.  Booker is taken by boat to an island lighthouse near Maine that houses a rocket silo, from which he is taken to Columbia. His arrival there is initially quiet; he is baptized by the population before allowed to explore the city. However, while at a carnival, one citizen notices a tattoo on Booker s wrist, with the letters  AD , a sign of a  false shephard  that will bring Comstock s downfall by taking away his  lamb , purportedly Elizabeth. Booker becomes a target of Comstock s forces from this discovery, and he is forced into the conflict of the city while still seeking Elizabeth. Though Booker finds Elizabeth easily enough, he quickly discovers that Elizabeth is central to the civil war raging in the city, her rescue being the start of the chain of events that ultimately lead to Columbia s down fall. Elizabeth, when first rescued, is meek and timid, and only just coming to grasp her abilities with her powers, but as she is escorted by Booker, becomes bolder and more confident, shown through both physical appearance and her changes in outfit. Each faction seeks to use Elizabeth to turn the tide of the conflict in their favor; the Founders believe Elizabeth s powers can help end the conflict and place them back in control, while the Vox Populi would rather kill Elizabeth than allow the Founders to get their hands on her, believing a prophecy that if Elizabeth falls, so does Columbia. Booker and Elizabeth are forced to place their trust in one another in order to escape. Elizabeth also seeks to understand the powers that she has been given, believing Comstock to be responsible, and refuses to leave Columbia until she learns the truth. Booker comes to fear the power that Elizabeth possesses; a scene during one of the game s preview trailers shows Booker to be more afraid of Elizabeth than God. To complicate matters, the pair is chased by Songbird, a large, robotic bird like creature who had been Elizabeth s friend and warden over the last twelve years of her imprisonment. Songbird was designed by its creator to feel betrayal should Elizabeth escape, comparable to an abusive spouse, according to Hilary Goldstein of IGN, and Elizabeth notes she  would rather be killed than be recaptured by Songbird.   In addition to the internal strife, Columbia is ravaged by tears in the fabric of space time. The game begins with a quote from a fictional work Barriers to Trans dimensional Travel purportly published in 1889. A strange shimmering effect as seen by Booker causes momentary changes to pictures, banners, and people, representing the nearby presence of a tear; in one example, Booker, while watching a Founder give a speech, experiences a brief shimmer where a patriotic button on the Founder s jacket briefly changes to that of the hammer and sickle associated with Communism. The tears have brought seemingly anachronistic elements into the Columbia of 1912; for example, an early gameplay demo footage features a record player in a bar plays a woman singing the lyrics to Tears for Fears  1985 song  Everybody Wants to Rule the World ; a later press reveal included similar covers of 1933 s  Goodnight, Irene  by Huddie Ledbetter, sung in chorus by a large group of Columbia s citizens, 1966 s  God Only Knows  by The Beach Boys, sung by a barbershop quartet, and 1983 s  Girls Just Want To Have Fun  by Cyndi Lauper. 1UP.com s preview of the 2011 E3 game demonstration denotes that at one point, Booker and Elizabeth find themselves in 1983, evident by a movie marquee showing Revenge of the Jedi  the original working name for Return of the Jedi , a result of a misfire of Elizabeth s powers involving tears in the fabric of space time when she tries to help revive a horse. The scene was part in a media preview event in December 2012, though in this case, the events occurred within a test laboratory, with Elizabeth expressing an interest in going to Paris and opening a rift to see the marquee for the film in French  La Revanche du Jedi .  Levine has stated that the ending of Infinite is  like nothing you ve experienced in a video game before ; the story purposely avoids a problem that arose from the original BioShock in which, after the death of Andrew Ryan in the middle of the game,  the story loses some of its steam .  Though the game takes place before the events of the previous two BioShock games  occurring in 1960 and 1968, respectively , Irrational Games has not confirmed if BioShock Infinite shares the same universe with these titles; Ken Levine left the question of the possibility unanswered in an interview stemming from the game s announcement.');
